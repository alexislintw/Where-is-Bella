"a1s1d2-2"="a pair of little shoes also with Annie' name on them, and pictures of Annie in the kindergarten...";
"a1s1d3"="Could Annie think that Bella's shoes were hers too?";
"a1s1d4"="Why would Annie think that? She is 7 years old now. She should be able to understand that she needs to give other people's belongings back to them.";
"a1s1d5"="So, there must be some motivation and reason why Annie kept Bella's shoes.";
"a1s1d6"="Such as...?";
"a1s1d7"="Bella should be like something precious and worth collecting to Annie.";

//Scene 1-2
"a1s2d1"="Look at this paper plane, there are letters on the paper.";
"a1s2d2-1"="This is a letter Annie wrote to her father.";
"a1s2d2-2"="『Dear Daddy, I don't want to have a new father. I hope you can come back and be re-married to mom and have a little sister to keep me accompanied,";
"a1s2d2-3"="one just as cute as Bella next door. I will help to take care of my little sister! Daddy, could you please come home? Annie. June 2013.』";

//Scene 1-5

"a2s5d2-1"="Who would know if what he said was true or not? He hates kids and is unfriendly to the community.";
"a2s5d2-2"="It could be that he wanted to kidnap little Bella so he took off his gloves.";

"a2s5d5"="Did you not say that you saw nurse Emily walking into the kitchen at Bella's home and blocking your view to Annie and Bella?";
"a2s5d6"="That's right! She should have be chatting with everyone at Bella's home. Why was she out here?";
"a2s5d7"="We have to find nurse Emily!";

//Act 3

//Scene 3-2

//Scene 3-3
"a3s3d1"="Here's Emily's cell phone.";
"a3s3d2"="The text says: We had broken up already. Please stop coming to harass me. Please stop making up stories about a child of ours as well.";

"a3s4d3"="From this note it looks like there's a secret transaction going on between Emily and Michelle.";
"a3s4d4"="Is this selling a kid?";
"a3s4d5"="Or is someone wanting to buy a kid?";
"a3s4d6"="Nurse Emily must know. There's her phone number on the note. Let's ask her with the spirit calling mirror.";

//Scene 3-5
"a3s5d1-1"="Sounds like that Emily is really in pain. ";
"a3s5d1-2"="She really wants to have a happy family and be reunited with her ex-boyfriend.";

//Scene 4-3
"a4s3d1"="This is a bracelet that Bella always carries with her! Why is it here?";
"a4s3d2"="It's on the beach viewing platform. Does that mean Bella had been here?";
"a4s3d3"="I think Mr. Pierre is very suspicious, he was in prison before.";
"a4s3d4"="In prison? What for?";
"a4s3d5"="I heard that it was at a party at his friend's house when he was 16, the group of young people was on drug and went out of control when he accidentally injured someone.";
"a4s3d6"="So, how did he start his own glass art studio?";
"a4s3d7"="He met a master glass maker when he was in prison. So, Pierre started doing glass art creation when he was released on parole.";
"a4s3d8-1"="If Pierre is someone who is so dedicated to art creation, he should be someone who has very a delicate mind.";
"a4s3d8-2"="Besides, he wouldn't commit other crimes while on parole.";

//Scene 4-4
"a4s4d1"="The thoughts of someone who would commit a crime often is illogical.";
"a4s4d2"="We have to find more evidence in order to make the whole thing clear.";
"a4s4d3"="Look! It's Bella's pinafore! Why is it in Pierre's studio?";

//Scene 4-5
"a4s5d1"="I hope what Pierre said was all true.";
"a4s5d2"="If he had proven that Emily had left the scene, we would have to ask who else could be a suspect?";
"a4s5d3-1"="This Ryan is a mess! He borrowed Pierre's trolley, but instead of returning it to Pierre, he just left it on the beach.";
"a4s5d3-2"="I wonder what other naughty things will he be up to!";

"a5s1d3"="There are a few letters engraved on the gun.";
"a5s1d4"="RN... it's Ryan's name! Why is his gun in Annie's play room?";
"a5s1d5"="Looks like Ryan had been here. A little boy always pays special attention to the girl that he likes.";

//Scene 5-3
"a5s3d1"="Look! Here's a slipper of Ryan's.";
"a5s3d2"="One slipper? Was he running away in a panic?";
"a5s3d3"="Look at the decorations here, it is not like a common terrifying tunnel.";
"a5s3d4"="It seems like Ryan likes to go explore everywhere!";

//Scene 5-4
"a5s4d1"="Here's Ryan's frisbee again. Seems like he had been here too.";
"a5s4d2"="This guy is such a troublemaker! Doesn't his parents keep an eye on him at all?";
"a5s4d3"="Sometimes an adult just can't control what a kid does!";
"a5s4d4"="Still, let's ask Ryan what had he done really?";

//Scene 5-5
"a5s5d1"="You see! I told you that Ryan is a kid who likes to explore and poke fun at the girls.";

"a5s5d3-1"="Ryan mentioned uncle Robert. He was at Kaden's party as well.";
"a5s5d3-2"="Let's go see whether if he had recorded anything during this time period. Maybe we will find some new clues.";

//Act 6

//Scene 6-1
"a6s1d1"="This is strange! Did Mrs. Robert not just give birth to a fourth boy? Why is there a baby girl's diaper?";
"a6s1d2"="That is indeed strange! And it's the same kind as what Bella's wearing.";
"a6s1d3"="All the images in the dolly are little kids.";
"a6s1d4"="Maybe he is a bit pedophile?";

//Scene 6-2
"a6s2d1"="Why is there a baby's rattle toy in Robert's camera bag?";
"a6s2d2"="Maybe it's a prop to make babies laugh during the photo shoot.";

//Scene 6-4
"a6s4d1"="This is Robert's camera.";
"a6s4d2"="Let's see what pictures had he taken.";
"a6s4d3"="Oh no! There are all pictures of Bella! Robert's eyeing Bella!";
"a6s4d4-1"="Let's try not to make a big fuss first! Bella is so cute, she will definitely draw a photographer's attention... ";
"a6s4d4-2"="But, whole camera full of Bella's images, and it's at Kaden's birthday party. This does sound a bit strange!";
"a6s4d5"="He must be an extreme pedophilia... That's terrible! Maybe that baby's rattle toy was used to lure Bella!";

//Scene 6-5
"a6s5d1"="Taking pictures is a process of creation, as well as a compensatory mentality, trying to retain the memories.";
"a6s5d2"="Actually, girls are as good as boys, why should we desire a particular gender so much?";
"a6s5d3"="That's exactly what people say, \"What you don't have, you want.\" Taking pictures is also a way to own, or I should say... another form of owning.";
"a6s5d4"="Did Robert say that he last saw Michelle and Emily talking about some secrets?";
"a6s5d5"="Looks like Michelle is the last person for us to investigate!";

//Act 7

//Scene 7-1
"a7s1d1"="Why is Bella's pacifier in Michelle's purse?";
"a7s1d2"="I don't remember this as Bella's pacifier. Maybe it's just an ordinary pacifier instead of Bella's?";
"a7s1d3"="Are you sure? You have to think carefully about it, don't make a mistake!";
"a7s1d4"="It does look quite alike... Bella has many pacifiers, I can't be sure if this is Bella's.";

//Scene 7-2
"a7s2d1"="Why would there be so many baby pictures? It's arranged so comfortably! Bella would definitely love to play here!";
"a7s2d2"="Hey, don't forget that we are still doing our investigation!";
"a7s2d3"="I know! I know! Look! Here's a picture of Bella taken at the hospital when she was just born!";
"a7s2d4"="Strange! How did Michelle get this photo?";
"a7s2d5"="Did we not just find out that Ms. Michelle seemed to have done something secret for Emily at the hospital?";
"a7s2d6"="Ms. Emily was the nurse at the hospital when Bella was born!";
"a7s2d7"="So, Bella is the baby that Ms. Michelle wants to adopt?";

//Scene 7-4
"a7s4d1"="Look! This is an IOU of a huge loan from Michelle to Pierre.";
"a7s4d2"="What did I say! How could Pierre have all the money to start a business right after he came out of the prison?";
"a7s4d3-1"="There must be a reason why Michelle was willing to loan Pierre the money.";
"a7s4d3-2"="It also says on the back of this IOU that a creative treasure of the world can be used as the payment.";
"a7s4d4"="World treasure? Creative art? She had such confidence in him!";
"a7s4d5"="I think Michelle meant something else.";
"a7s4d6"="A world treasure... a real nursery... you mean what she was referring to as the world treasure was a baby!";

//Scene 7-5
"a7s5d1"="It's true that it's unfair that a piece of paper should determine someone's future!";
"a7s5d2"="Hey, we are looking for suspects. Don't become too sympathetic!";
"a7s5d3"="Looks like one of these seven had hidden the truth.";
"a7s5d4"="Let's spread out these clues and try to find Bella fast!";

//Ending
"a8s1d1"="King Kong and Molly rush to the car. They find Emily's car, with some luggage inside, and a window opened up with a little gap. Inside the window Bella safely sleeps in the safety seat. ";
"a8s2d1"="After the mystery is solved, Bella rubs her eyes and gives a bright smile. Just like nothing had ever happened.";
