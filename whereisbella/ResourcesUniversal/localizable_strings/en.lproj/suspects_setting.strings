//人物檔案
"s1p1"="A seven-year-old girl, Bella's neighbor, who lives with her mother without any brothers or sisters.

But her mother is going to be married to a new father soon, so her hope was shattered and she can only sadly play by herself alone.";

"s2p1"="A 54-year-old white man who is obsessed with cleanliness and lives alone by himself next door to Bella.

"s3p1"="28-year-old white female. She was the nurse who was taking care of Bella at the hospital when she was just born. Her boyfriend who was 4 years younger than her and works in New York broke up with her because he did no want to get married so soon. \n\nEmily lied to him telling him that she was pregnant and had given birth to his child. So, when Bella was born, she really hoped that Bella was her own child...";

"s6p1"="Robert is an amateur photographer who owns an import-export company but does not have the desire to run it. He is passionate about taking pictures and love to collect all kinds of antique cameras. So, he does his amateur job very professionally and owns a lot of professional grade equipment, and often is at the beach taking wedding pictures during the holidays. \n\nHe has three sons and his wife just gave birth to their fourth boy. He was disappointed about it because he always wanted to have a daughter.";

"s7p1"="Michelle lives next door to Bella, and was the previous owner of Bella's house who just sold this beautiful beach villa to Bella's parents last year. But she never told Bella's parents that there is a secret passageway between the two houses that connects them. \n\nMichelle loves children. She got married and had children when she was very young. She is 40 years old this year. Her husband passed away two years ago. Her two children had also gone to colleges in other states.
